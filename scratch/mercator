# Abstract purported equivalence

There’s some weird math that I don’t understand that relates Mercator and
Stereographic as being on some kind of continuum using polyconic projections?


# Strange apparent equivalence

When using stereographic projection (doubled) to zoom equirect, I was quite
surprised after going through the “Mercator Redemption” paper and going through
a more involved ceremony to do the same thing with Mercator, having to not
double the projection size but to actually rotate the globe 90° toward the
north pole, shift the projection down, then unrotate the globe -90°, produced
the same image as the simpler stereographic.


# Is there a simple equivalence

Both cylinder and spheres look like circles from top-down.

Panini is cylindrical            \_____   relationship known
Stereographic is spherical       /


Mercator is cylindrical 


Fisheye is an unrolling of a sphere
Equirect is an unrolling of a cylinder

Rectilinear is a perspective at the center of an idealized globe

Panini is a perspective from a cylinder perimeter
Stereographic is a perspective from a sphere perimeter

Cylindrical is both:
  - an unrolling of a cylinder
  - and a perspective at the center of a cylinder

Mercator is both:
  - an unrolling of a cylinder
  - and a perspective from a cylinder perimeter???? <-----



Deriving Stereographic

  forward (sphere xyz -> plane xy)
    plane @ z=1
    camera @ z=-1
    sphere radius of 1 @ z=0


    dz = z > 0 ? 1+z : 1-z     <---- z distance between point and cam
    z' = 2                     <---- z distance between plane and cam


     x/dz = x'/2
 => 2x/dz = x'

Deriving Mercator

  (dud)


stereographic maps 360° to an infinite line

centered perspective maps 180° to an infinite line

mercator maps 180° to an infinite line

  take the poles of the globe, squash them to the center 
    the globe now looks like a torus (donut) whose center donut-hole is of radius 0




(I’ve probably explored one of these already)

1. y = stereographic projection of the 180° meridians

    forward:
      u = lon
      v = 2*tan(lat/2)

    inverse:
      lon = u
      lat = 2*atan(v/2)

2. y = stereographic projection of the 180° meridians if the poles were squashed to the center (a horn torus)

    forward:
      u = lon
      v = 2*tan(lat)

    inverse:
      lon = u
      lat = atan(v/2)
