UI:
  - make fov scrollbar non-linear
  - show scrollbar if controlsOn and flexfov is off

FOG:
  - in `gfx_sp_vertex` fog_z is calculated after projection (z/w)
      float winv = 1.0f / w;
      float fog_z = z * winv * rsp.fog_mul + rsp.fog_offset;
    - need to understand what the projection matrix really is doing with the w-component
