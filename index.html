I come to a blue sky of blocky clouds, as a player in a dream.  A profile of a
crowned girl appears out of me, then moves behind calling words on a floating page.

The page and the girl leave slowly like apparitions, but after a pause alone,
a golden creature meets me quickly from below, flying on a personal cloud.  He
faces me with two eyes and a camera, and pulls away and pitches down.

<p>
I follow him down as my frame is pierced first by a spire, then its steeple and a large castle.
We focus a moment on a glass stained with the girl I saw, then out toward the
field and water around it.
