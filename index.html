I come to a blue sky of blocky clouds,
as a player in a dream.
A profile of a crowned girl appears out of me,
then moves behind calling words on a floating page.

<p>
The page and the girl leave slowly like apparitions, but after a pause alone,
I look down to see a golden creature flying on a personal cloud.
He faces me with two eyes and a camera, and pulls away and pitches down.

I float loosely with him as he descends,
past a spire and around its steeple.
I spot a green carapace on his back, against the rising red roof of the full castle.
</p>

<p>
We push out from a grand window,
stained with the girl who appeared out of me, just as I saw her.
After seeing the full church-like castle,
I feel whisked away to chase the turtle toward an outer pond,
then back toward the castle through its moat.
After racing under the stone bridge,
we pull high over on orchard and alight beside a hill.
</p>

<p>
The turtle slows in focused orbit at the ground,
as green pottery arises from the dirt.
