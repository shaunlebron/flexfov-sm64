I come to a blue sky of blocky clouds,
as a player in a dream.
A profile of a crowned girl appears out of me,
then moves behind calling words on a floating page.

The page and the girl leave slowly like apparitions, but after a pause alone,
I look down to see a golden creature flying on a personal cloud.
He faces me with two eyes and a camera, and pulls away and pitches down.

I float loosely with him as he descends,
past a spire and around its steeple.
I spot a green carapace on his back,
against the rising red roof of the full castle.
</p>

<p>
We push out from a grand window,
stained with the girl who appeared out of me, just as I saw her.
After seeing the full church-like castle,
I am whisked away to chase the turtle toward an outer pond,
then inward through the castle moat.
After passing under the stone bridge,
we pull high over on orchard and alight beside a hill.
</p>

<p>
The turtle whips over my head then around a focused orbit at the ground,
eyeing a pipe of green clay now breaching yellow dirt.
My vision cuts to his camera’s eye, now physically in the world.
Icons with numbers float in the corners of my new view.
</p>

<p>
The pipe from the view is an eight-sided well.
I can’t quite see into its dark opening,
but my camera pulls back to follow something out—
a man leaping into the world out of the plumbing.
</p>

<p>
The camera catches him at his apex below the sun
against the blue sky of blocky clouds,
and he lands in front of me
in deep animated breaths.
</p>

<p>
He seems to stare through me, fixed on the castle.
The hovering turtle swings me slowly around,
completing an orbit now fixed on him
as the green clay falls back into the dirt.
</p>

<p>
We hover behind and above him,
aligned now to his line of sight,
as I am introduced to the synchrony of control:
I hover with my vision above,
and manifest through actions below.
