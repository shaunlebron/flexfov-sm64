I come to a blue sky of blocky clouds,
as a player in a dream.
A profile of a crowned girl appears out of me,
then moves behind calling words on a floating page.

<p>
The page and the girl leave slowly like apparitions.
After a pause alone, I look down to see an amber turtle.
He is sitting on a cloud no bigger than he is,
facing me with two eyes and a camera.
He floats back on his cloud and begins gliding down.

<p>
I float loosely with him as he descends,
past a spire and around its steeple.
I spot a green carapace on his back,
against the rising red roof of the full castle.
</p>

<p>
We push out from a grand window,
stained in the image of the girl, as I had just seen her.
After seeing the full church-like castle,
I am whisked away to chase the turtle toward an outer pond,
then inward through the castle moat.
After passing under the stone bridge,
we pull high over on orchard and alight beside a hill.
</p>

<p>
The turtle whips over my head then around a focused orbit at the ground,
eyeing a pipe of green clay now breaching yellow dirt.
My vision cuts to his cameraâ€™s eye, now physically in the world.
Icons with numbers float in the corners of my new view.
</p>

<p>
The pipe from the view is an eight-sided well.
Before I can peer into its dark opening,
my camera whips back to catch
a man leaping into the world out of the plumbing.
</p>

<p>
The camera frames him at a dramatic apex below the sun
against the same blue sky of blocky clouds,
and he lands in front of me
in deep animated breaths.
</p>

<p>
He seems to gaze through me toward the castle
as the green pipe burrows itself behind him.
The turtle swings me around him to
bring both subject and object in frame.
</p>

<p>
A thought bubble twirls at me like a newspaper,
suggesting that not only do I have vision above,
but I may act through Mario below.
</p>

<p>
I move him throughout the garden in play,
the turtle trails him allowing my vision to follow.
I approach the castle bridge from the top this time,
and a new turtle flies down to a second twirling thought.
</p>

<p>
He says I may also act through my carrier, but not completely.
I may influence where Lakitu carries me but we share control.
He has his own personality, but he listens to my nudges if he can.
</p>

<p>
<s>In consonance with this shared control, I added something more.</s>
