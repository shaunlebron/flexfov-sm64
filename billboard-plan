get absolute position of the billboard inside the entity
  multiplying the billboard frame (relative)
    by the entity root frame (absolute)

compute the billboard absolute orientation (cam - absPos)

convert this orientation to be relative to the billboard frame
  multiply by the inverse of the entity frame => orientation relative to entity
    then multiply by the inverse of the billboard frame => orientation relative to billboard


entity frame -> gCurGraphNodeRoot
...hopefully no intermediate frames...
billboard frame -> Mat4 dest (passed to mtxf_billboard)



when looking at fixed tree:
  x+ right
  y+ up
  z+ toward camera


currently:
  geo_process_object(w/flag GRAPH_RENDER_BILLBOARD) (billboard-only objects: trees, coins)          -> cylboards
  geo_process_billboard                             (billboards inside objects: bob-ombs, chukyahs) -> billboard

objects:
  parts (bob-ombs, scuttlebugs, chuckyas, skeeters)
  wholes (trees, coins)



mtxf_billboard: quads always parallel to the rendering plane
  x-axis camera right
  y-axis camera up
  z-axis camera forward

mtxf_cylboard (turnstile): billboards with
  x-axis (y cross z)
  y-axis world up
  z-axis (object - camera)

mtxf_sphereboards (selfie-stick): billboards with
  x-axis (y cross z)
  y-axis camera up
  z-axis (object - camera)



  coins:                 will tear at cube seams
  bob-bombs, chuckyahs:  parts displaced (relative to origin of entity, rather than world?)

  billboards tear at seams
  
  


problem:
  billboards are inconsistent across cube seams (tearing)
  billboards distort toward rectilinear boundaries (when projected onto environment map sphere)

solution:
  create a functional sphereboard function to fix both problems
    for BOTH pure billboards (coins) and billboard parts inside otherwise 3d objects (bob-ombs, chukyahs)



how to diagnose sphereboard problems:
  make knowns clear

knowns:
  position of an entity (coin, bob-omb) 
  position of camera
  matrix of billboard

unknowns:
  how matrix is used
    is it multiplied by anything else?
    can we trace it to the final vertices given to opengl?

how to verify theory about what matrix should be doing?:
  visualize the positions and matrix vectors


how to target one object for diagnosis?:
  isolate the outdoor castle billboards to a single tree
    tracking marioâ€™s position
      rendering the billboard closest to him?
    or using a counter to isolate by count
